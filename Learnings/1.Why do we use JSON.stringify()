We use JSON.stringify() primarily for two main purposes:

Serialization: Serialization refers to the process of converting data 
structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored 
(e.g., in a file or database) or transmitted over a network. 
When we stringify an object using JSON.stringify(), 
we convert it into a JSON string representation. 
This string can then be easily transmitted over the
 network or stored in a file or database.

Data Interchange: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange
format because it is human-readable and widely supported across different 
programming languages. By converting objects into JSON strings using JSON.stringify(), 
we can send data between different systems or applications. The recipient can then 
parse the JSON string back into an object using JSON.parse().
